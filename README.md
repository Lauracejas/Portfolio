# Portfolio
AS AN employer
I WANT to create a potential employee's deployed portfolio of my work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of my work and assess whether I'am a good candidate for an open position.

## Description

- This repository is my personal portfolio that I create to showcase my skills, my most important work and the thought processes behind it. Here you can know a little about me, you can contact me through email, phone, GitHub and LinkedIn and you can also find my resume.
- Following the requirements, I made the HTML and CSS files as short and accessible as I could. In the HTML file I created three sections in the main to divide the content (about me, work, and contact me).
- In the CSS and HTML file I commented out any changes made to the code for futures developers understand.


## Requirements

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
